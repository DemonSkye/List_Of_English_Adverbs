# List_Of_English_Adverbs
Since it is devilishly hard to find a list of adverbs for the english language without having to copy paste bullshit from an article this should help you. This is mainly aimed at students, nlp researchers, and others. I will actively monitor this repo for PR's and will merge in submissions that make sense.
